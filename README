MYFS -- A Ram File System Implementation

Version : myfs v0.01
Author : Krishna Pai

This is a simple ram file system module. Right now , it supports only files of
size 40kb.Why ? Well , getting higher file sizes is less of an issue than making
sure, I support all the file operations required. Once I do that , I will
expand it to support any size of files. This still very much a work in
progress ,that I do in my spare time. So its quite buggy ! :) .
Any creative input is highly appreaciated.
